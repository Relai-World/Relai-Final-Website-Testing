# AWS Instance Connectivity Troubleshooting

## Root Cause Analysis
All SSH methods failing suggests one of these issues:

### 1. Instance Network Configuration
- **Subnet**: Instance might be in private subnet without internet access
- **Route Table**: Missing route to Internet Gateway
- **Network ACL**: Blocking SSH traffic

### 2. Security Group Issues
- SSH (port 22) might not be properly configured
- Source IP restrictions might be too narrow

### 3. Instance Issues
- EC2 Instance Connect service not properly installed
- SSH daemon not running
- Instance in wrong availability zone

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Check Instance Details
1. Go to EC2 Console → Instance Details
2. Verify **Subnet** is public (has route to internet gateway)
3. Check **Security Groups** have SSH (22) open to 0.0.0.0/0
4. Verify **Public IP** is actually assigned

### Fix 2: Use Different Connection Method
Try AWS CloudShell:
1. AWS Console → CloudShell icon (>_)
2. Wait for shell to load
3. Run: `aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-018d44dba9dd00241`
4. Check if instance has proper network configuration

### Fix 3: Alternative Deployment
Since your Replit version works perfectly:
1. **Use Replit Deploy** (fastest option)
2. **Deploy to Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
3. **Deploy to Railway**: One-click Node.js deployment
4. **Use AWS App Runner**: Deploy from GitHub directly

## Recommended Action
Since you need the application accessible at an external IP immediately, use Replit's deployment feature. It will give you a production URL that works identically to your development version.

Later, you can troubleshoot the AWS connectivity issues or use alternative platforms.

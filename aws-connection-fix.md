# AWS Connection Fix

## Issue Identified
Your AWS instance is running correctly with proper security groups, but there might be an IP mismatch.

## Get Correct Connection Details

### Step 1: Get the correct Public IP
In your AWS Console:
1. Click on the instance ID: `i-018d44dba9dd00241`
2. In the details pane, find the **Public IPv4 address**
3. Also note the **Public IPv4 DNS** name

### Step 2: Connect using correct details
```cmd
# Use the exact Public IP from AWS Console
ssh -i "C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\my-pem-key.pem" ubuntu@[ACTUAL_PUBLIC_IP]

# Or use the Public DNS name
ssh -i "C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\my-pem-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-201-223-222.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

### Step 3: Alternative connection methods
If SSH still doesn't work, use AWS Systems Manager:

1. **Session Manager**: In AWS Console, go to Systems Manager â†’ Session Manager
2. **Connect**: Click "Start session" and select your instance
3. **Browser-based terminal**: This bypasses SSH entirely

## Quick Test
Try connecting with the Public DNS name instead of IP:
```cmd
ssh -i "C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\my-pem-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-201-223-222.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

The Public DNS name is often more reliable than the IP address for AWS connections.

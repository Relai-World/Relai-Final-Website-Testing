# Alternative Deployment Options

Since direct SSH access to 13.201.223.222 is blocked, here are your options:

## Option 1: Check Server Status
- **AWS Console**: Log into AWS and check if the EC2 instance is running
- **Security Groups**: Ensure port 22 (SSH) and port 5000 (HTTP) are open
- **Instance State**: Verify the instance is in "running" state

## Option 2: Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager
```bash
# If you have AWS CLI configured:
aws ssm start-session --target i-your-instance-id
```

## Option 3: Deploy on Different Platform
Since you have the working Replit version, consider:
- **Replit Deployments**: Click "Deploy" button in Replit
- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
- **Netlify**: Deploy from GitHub repository
- **Railway**: One-click deployment from GitHub

## Option 4: Use Replit as Production
Your Replit URL is already working perfectly:
- Change it to a custom domain if needed
- Use Replit's deployment features
- It's already serving the full application

## Option 5: Fix Server Access
If this is an AWS EC2 instance:
1. Check Security Group rules
2. Ensure SSH (port 22) is open to your IP
3. Ensure HTTP (port 5000) is open to 0.0.0.0/0
4. Verify the instance is running
5. Check if Elastic IP is correctly assigned

## Immediate Working Solution
Your Replit application is already fully functional and production-ready. You could:
1. Use the current Replit URL for production
2. Set up a custom domain pointing to it
3. It connects to the same MongoDB database
4. All features are working correctly

Would you like to:
A) Try to fix the server access issues
B) Deploy using Replit's deployment feature
C) Use an alternative platform like Vercel/Netlify
D) Troubleshoot the AWS EC2 instance
